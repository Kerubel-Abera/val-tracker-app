## Overview

Welcome to the Valorant Tracker App! This is a personal project developed to showcase my skills as an Android developer. The app serves as a stat tracker for the popular game "Valorant" by Riot Games, providing users with a user-friendly interface to view their account statistics.

Please note that this app is still in development, and some features may be incomplete or subject to change.

## Features

- **Valorant API Integration:** The app leverages Hendrik's Valorant API to retrieve account statistics efficiently.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Data obtained from the API is presented in a user-friendly manner, making it easy for users to understand their performance in the game.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern is followed to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

- **Dependency Injection with Dagger-Hilt:** Dagger-Hilt is used for streamlined development and to manage dependencies effectively.

- **Retrofit & OkHTTP:** Data retrieval from the API is accomplished using Retrofit and OkHTTP libraries, ensuring efficient communication.

## How to Test

To test the app, you can use the following Valorant usernames:

1. Username: JoshË†, Tag: NA1
2. Username: Mike Oxlong, Tag: 7239
3. Username: Emily, Tag: 2005

Feel free to enter any of the above usernames in the app to see the account statistics. Please note that the users of these usernames could change them at any time. I will do my best to update this.
